# Simple To-Do App

A clean, responsive, and feature-rich to-do list application built from scratch using only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates modern web development practices, including DOM manipulation, local storage, and a state-first logic approach.

## ✨ Features
Full CRUD Functionality: Add, complete, and delete your to-do items.

Data Persistence: Tasks are automatically saved to the browser's Local Storage, so your list is preserved even after you close or refresh the page.

Date & Time Tracking: Every task is automatically timestamped with its creation date and time, which is displayed below the task.

Pagination: To keep the list clean and manageable, the app automatically paginates your tasks, showing 10 items per page. "Previous" and "Next" buttons appear when needed.

Responsive Design: The layout is fully responsive and works beautifully on both desktop and mobile devices.

Modern Animations: Subtle animations for adding, completing, and removing tasks provide a smooth and attractive user experience.
